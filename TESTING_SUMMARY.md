# Testing Summary - AI Program Factory

## ‚úÖ What's Been Built Today

### 1. Bug Fixes
- **Data Access Bug** - Fixed "could not access data" error in matrix generation
- **API Data Path** - Corrected frontend to use `data.data.X` instead of `data.session.data.X`
- **Upload Path** - Fixed file upload to use `/tmp` on Render

### 2. Prompt Management System (MAJOR)
- **Admin UI**: http://localhost:8080/prompts.html
- **8 AI Prompts**: All editable through web interface
- **Validation**: Checks variables, braces, required fields
- **Reset**: Individual and bulk reset to defaults
- **Variable System**: {{variableName}} substitution

### 3. Enhanced Briefing System
- **7 New Fields**: Business context, challenges, learning gap, etc.
- **Document Upload**: AI extracts info from briefing docs
- **Rich Context**: Flows through all generation steps

### 4. Framework Selection Step (NEW)
- **Missing Step Added**: Between Brief and Route Selection
- **3 Frameworks**: AI generates alternatives with recommendation
- **Human Choice**: Select, request new options, or provide feedback
- **Narrows Scope**: Before content preparation begins

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Prompt Management UI
**URL**: http://localhost:8080/prompts.html

- [ ] Page loads and shows 8 prompts
- [ ] Can expand/collapse prompts
- [ ] Can click "Edit Prompt"
- [ ] Can modify text in textarea
- [ ] Click "Validate" shows feedback
- [ ] Can save changes successfully
- [ ] Click "Reset to Default" on one prompt works
- [ ] Click "Reset All to Defaults" works with double confirmation

**Expected Result**: All prompt operations work without errors

---

### Test 2: Enhanced Brief Form
**URL**: http://localhost:8080/workflow.html

- [ ] Click "Create New Session"
- [ ] Click "Fill Example" - should populate ALL fields including:
  - Client Name
  - Industry
  - Business Context (long text)
  - Business Challenges (multi-line)
  - Learning Gap
  - Target Audience
  - Learning Objectives
  - Additional Context
- [ ] Submit form
- [ ] Should advance to Framework Selection (not Route Selection)

**Expected Result**: Brief saves with all new fields, advances to framework_selection

---

### Test 3: Framework Selection Step
**Continuing from Test 2...**

- [ ] Framework Selection page appears automatically
- [ ] Shows "Generating frameworks..." loading state
- [ ] Displays 3 framework cards
- [ ] One card highlighted as "Recommended"
- [ ] Shows recommendation reasoning
- [ ] Each card shows:
  - Name
  - Description
  - Theoretical Basis
  - Approach
  - Best For (3 items)
  - Considerations (3 items)
- [ ] Can click "Select This Framework" button
- [ ] Advances to Route Selection

**Alternative Flow:**
- [ ] Enter feedback in textarea
- [ ] Click "Generate New Options"
- [ ] Should show 3 NEW framework options

**Expected Result**: Framework selection works, advances to route_selection

### Test 4: Route A Full Workflow
**Starting fresh session...**

1. **Brief** ‚Üí Fill and save
2. **Framework** ‚Üí Select a framework
3. **Route** ‚Üí Select Route A
4. **Upload** ‚Üí Upload sample training doc
5. **Content Review** ‚Üí Approve content
6. **Approach Selection** ‚Üí Select approach (e.g., scenario-based)
7. **Arc Generation** ‚Üí Auto-generates, then review
8. **Arc Review** ‚Üí Approve arc
9. **Matrix Generation** ‚Üí Generate matrix
10. **Matrix Review** ‚Üí Should display matrix with sessions
11. **Sample Generation** ‚Üí Generate sample
12. **Sample Validation** ‚Üí Should show article + quiz
13. **Batch Generation** ‚Üí Generate all sessions
14. **Completed** ‚Üí Download options appear

**Expected Result**: Complete workflow without errors, generates training content

---

### Test 5: Prompt Editing Impact
1. Go to /prompts.html
2. Edit "Sample Content Generation" prompt
3. Add custom instruction: "CRITICAL: Include a real-world example in EVERY paragraph"
4. Save changes
5. Run Test 4 again (Route A workflow)
6. Check if sample content follows new instruction

**Expected Result**: Changes to prompts affect generated content

---

## üêõ Known Issues to Watch For

1. **Framework step might not show** - Check console for errors
2. **Old sessions** - May not work with new workflow (delete and recreate)
3. **Cache issues** - Use "Clear Cache" in prompts if changes don't apply
4. **Database state** - Delete `factory.db` if workflow behaves strangely

---

## üìä Test Results

### Issues Found During Testing:
1. ‚úÖ FIXED: Workflow was skipping framework_selection step
2. ‚úÖ FIXED: Brief form not advancing to correct step

### Remaining to Test:
- Prompt management full cycle
- Framework generation with real brief
- End-to-end Route A workflow
- Business context flowing through to content
